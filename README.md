# Employee-Details-Form--Validation-Form-Use-Post-Mapping.
A simple web application built using **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, and **Hibernate Validator** to demonstrate **form validation** using `@PostMapping`.   This project validates employee input fields such as First Name, Department, and Skills, and displays validation messages directly on the form.
